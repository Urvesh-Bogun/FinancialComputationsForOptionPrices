# Option Pricing Models

A Python implementation of financial models to calculate option prices for **American** and **European** calls and puts. The project includes:
- **Black-Scholes Model**
- **Binomial Trees**
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to price options using three different models:
1. **Black-Scholes**: A closed-form solution for European options.
2. **Binomial Trees**: A discrete-time model for both American and European options.
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: A numerical method for pricing options using random sampling.
